# 📱 Addiction Free

This is a solution I’ve developed, designed to help people tackle addiction through accountability and daily motivation *iOS Only*
The *Screenshots* and the **Demo Video** are in the bottom of the readme.

## 🖋️ App's Description

This app is more than just a nice addition to your life; it is intended for use in helping you to overcome addiction. It provides inspirational quotes every hour to help you stay motivated. If you want, you can log your progress in an easy manner, and a streak counter will be there to keep you pumped up with motivation for all your hard work.

## 💡 Concept

I’d like to utilize an app to help people overcome addiction. The idea is to give addicts a daily progress tracker. It's the accountability and motivation that is necessary for them to succeed.

## 📝 Plan

- **Progress Calendar**: A calendar that visualizes progress, with days marked in green if they met their goal or red if they had a slip-up.
- **Motivational Notifications**: Daily motivational notifications that are encouraging and focused on staying accountable to themselves.
- **Streaks**: Goals in the app to build streaks. When they meet their goal, they continue their streak. If they don’t, their streak ends.
- **Prototype & Development**: I plan to first create a prototype using Python. I’ll then jump into developing my iOS app using SwiftUI.

## 🔒 Privacy

All data will remain **local** on the user’s device because I want to respect the user’s privacy. The app would be open source.

## 🏁 Goals


- ✅ Project desription
- ✅ Python prototype
- ✅ Design the app interface
- ✅ Write the app's front end
- ✅ Write the app's back end
- ✅ Make the icon name of the app
- ✅ Make haptic feedback

  ## 🔨 Usage
