# 🛠️ Addiction App

An app designed to help people overcome their addictions by tracking progress and providing daily motivation. 📱 *iOS Only*

## 💡 Idea

I wanted to create an app that supports people in their journey to overcome addictions by tracking their progress and keeping them motivated.

## 📝 Plan

- **Progress Calendar**: Users will have a calendar that visually tracks their progress. Each day will be marked in green if they succeed, or red if they don’t.
- **Motivational Notifications**: Daily motivational notifications will be sent to encourage users to stay on track.
- **Streaks**: Users can set goals and build streaks. The streak will reset if they fail to meet their goals.
- **Prototype & Development**: I will start by creating a prototype in Python, and then develop the actual app using SwiftUI.

## 🔒 Privacy

All data will be stored locally on the device, ensuring privacy. The app will also be open-source.
