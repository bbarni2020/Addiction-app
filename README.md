# 📱 Addiction App

This is a solution that I’m currently working on that is designed to help people tackle addiction through accountability and daily motivation. *iOS Only*

## 💡 Concept

I’d like to utilize an app to help people overcome addiction. The idea is to give addicts a daily progress tracker. It's the accountability and motivation that is necessary for them to succeed.

## 📝 Plan

- **Progress Calendar**: A calendar that visualizes progress, with days marked in green if they met their goal or red if they had a slip-up.
- **Motivational Notifications**: Daily motivational notifications that are encouraging and focused on staying accountable to themselves.
- **Streaks**: Goals in the app to build streaks. When they meet their goal, they continue their streak. If they don’t, their streak ends.
- **Prototype & Development**: I plan to first create a prototype using Python. I’ll then jump into developing my iOS app using SwiftUI.

## 🔒 Privacy

All data will remain **local** on the user’s device because I want to respect the user’s privacy. The app would be open source.

## 🏁 Goals


- ✅ Project desription
- ✅ Python prototype
- ✅ Design the app interface
- ✅ Write the app's front end
- ☑️ Write the app's back end
- ☑️ Make the icon name of the app
- ☑️ Finish the app and start advertising
